## ToDo
1. ~~Return/show the image after the colour swatch is uploaded.~~

2. ~~Reset state cleanly to allow multiple uploads.~~

3. Separate class to store images in a database along with their swatch.

4. Put database in separate module with dbAddress in an ENV var.

4. Abstract database class schema into an argument for the constructor;

5. Endpoint to query images in a gallery and show images next to their swatches.

5. Display gallery with bootstrap - investigate whether to use columns or flex.

5. Add a grouping - field. - i.e group by pink, green, red…

6. Query DB via GraphQL - query to get an image and it's swatch and then related images to that swatch.

7. Import from Instagram.

8. Make a spectrum sorted/ordered of instagram posts.

This colour thing could work:
 - query by colour
 - Query by image
 - Query by author
 - each has a list of the others…
